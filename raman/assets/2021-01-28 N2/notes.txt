N2 Raman

* Delay: 250 ps
* Pressure: 1 atm
* CFG Energy: 2.2mJ

y FP = 22.95mm
x = 17.64mm manual + 23.51mm motorized
raman threshold wavelength ~ 402nm
raman center wavelength = 398nm
notch center wavelength ~ 784nm

Observations
* Changing notch lateral position affected neighbouring Raman peak ratios
* Don't trust 2+ fiber data with nonzero vertical position. Positions may not match.

30kPa N2
10kPa OCS
circular probe
132ps delay for N2, 124ps delay for OCS
2.4 mJ
FP position 22.64

Observations
• First observe N2 and OCS Raman separately
• Then combine for mixture
• Place notch and adjust to block most OCS and allow N2 super rotors
• Change probe delay and observe no change in signal (no quantum beating)
• Switch to N2 and take data for some notch parameters
• Switch to OCS and take data for same notch parameters
